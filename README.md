# Unix Weather Application

Using the Open Weather API, I have built a very basic terminal based weather application. I did this just to get some little knowledge on `axios`, `nodejs`, `await` and `async` keywords from `node.js`.

### System Requirements
- Linux/MacOS with `bashrc` terminal working.

### Running the program

- Clone the Repo on your `home` directory:

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/feelthedimez/unix-weather-application.git
```

- Make `weather` file an executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/unix-weather-application/src/weather
```

- Create a univeral path for the bash (Copy and paste this into your terminal):

```bash
echo "export PATH=\"\$HOME/unix-weather-application/src:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- Create an API Key from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org)

1. Create a profile
2. Request for an API Key
3. Go to: (if using VSCode)
```bash
code ~/unix-weather-application/src/app.js
```
4. Update line `12`, replace the zeros `0000000000000000000000000000000000` with your API key.

- Run the program

You have to supply two System Arguments; `weather <city>`

```bash
weather johannesburg
# City: JOHANNESBURG
# Today's Temperature is 13.15Â°C
```

## COMING SOON - To be Implemented

- Showing winds, pressure and etc.
- Telling you what type of clothes you should wear depending on the weather (to-do with OOP)
- Having a config file of your current address
- Displaying data properly using a table
- Showing 5 next days of data
- Having a Web Application of the Weather using NodeJS & React
- and more.
